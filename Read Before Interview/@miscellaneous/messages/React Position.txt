Also, I want to add one point:
While I understand that the internship is offered at INR 10K per month, I am requesting a stipend of INR 22K to INR 25K per month for full-time. I believe this adjustment reflects my experience and dedication, and I am confident you will not be disappointed with this decision. With nearly a year of experience in frontend development, I am committed to delivering results that exceed expectations.

Since I've the required tech skills for the open position. If given an opportunity, I'd be a great fit.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.
