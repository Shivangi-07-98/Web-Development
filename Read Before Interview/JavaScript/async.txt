async arch

callstack : all the code that is written in javascript will run here. callstack does not wait for an async task completion.
Node API/Web API : all the async tasks like below execute or waits in apis area : 
- timers : setTimeout, setInterval
- HTTP request : 
1. Browser : XMLHTTP request [callback], fetch[promise]
2. nodejs : HTTP -> callback based and promise based on
- async crud functions
- browser eventlistener
- DB queries

waiting queue : all the callback of async functions are enqueued before being executed on the call stack

Event loop : 
1. it is an infinite loop that constantly checks your queue for callback functions if there is one and the stack is empty then it will push that function to the stack
2. event loop will always wait for callstack to be empty then only it will push the callback function in the callstack
