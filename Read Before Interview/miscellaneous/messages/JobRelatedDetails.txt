Why are you switching? or Reason for looking for a new opportunity - 
I am seeking new opportunities to further develop my skills and contribute to a team where I can continue to grow professionally. Additionally, the lack of growth opportunities and limited learning resources within the front-end development department hindered my professional development. I believe that by seeking a new position, I can find a role that aligns more closely with my career goals and provides a supportive environment for continued learning and advancement.
